# PokerCodeExercise
Requirements  :
Input to the system will consist of a string of 10 cards, the first 5 cards will represent the left hand and the remaining 5 cards will represent the right hand.  
For example, given the input of:  2H 5D JC AS 5H 4H QS 9S JD KH
Would translate to the left hand having:  2H 5D JC AS 5H 
1.	2 of Hearts
2.	5 of Diamonds
3.	Jack of Clubs
4.	Ace of Spades
5.	5 of Hearts
And the Right hand having:  4H QS 9S JD KH
1.	4 of Hearts
2.	Queen of Spades
3.	9 of Spades
4.	Jack of Diamonds
5.	King of Hearts
The application will read the input of hands and determine the winner or draw by outputting one of the following:
1.	Left Hand Wins
2.	Right Hand Wins
3.	Draw

Building the application :

Load the file PokerGameConsoleApp.sln in Visual Studio, 
and build the PokerGameConsoleAppâ€‹ project.

Running the application :

Run the PokerGameConsoleApp project, 
and at the command line enter the 
hands in the following format:
2C 3H 4S 8C 9D 2H 3D 5S 9C AH : RightHand Wins.
2S 4S 4C 2D 4H 2H 3D 5S AH 9C :LeftHand Wins.
2S 3S 4S 6S 5S KS JS AS QS TS : RightHand Wins.
2H 3D 5S AH 9C 2C 3S 4D 6H 5C : RightHand Wins.

Tools Used :

VS2017 and ASP.Net 4.7.1 framework have been used to implement PokerHand Code Exercise.
Model: Card.
Common : CardDataValidations, PokerConstants.
Enums are used for Suit, Ranks and HandTypes.
Business logic created for game analysis of two hands.
Console App created to process a game.

Unit Tests
Unit tests are available in the PokerGameConsoleApp project,
and can be run through the test explorer.

Unit Tests are for analysing the winners 
for LeftHand,RightHand or whether it is a draw.

Validation tests are for the folowing:
Invalid Inputs,
Invalid Length,
Duplicate Cards,
Invalid Rank 
and Invalid Suit

Solution Approach :

The application first asks the user to enter the input. If the user does not input and hits enter the application  validates it as an invalid input and asks if the user wants to play again. If the user says No it will end the game and if the user says Yes it will ask the user to input the cards. Once the user enters the input as given above it validates whether it has a valid length, valid Rank, valid Suit, and no duplicate cards.

If the input is valid the string is split for 2 players Left Hand and Right Hand.The application next analyses the Hands for each player and  gets the Hand Type for the player based on the rules of the game.Once the handtype is returned for both the players the application now compares the hand type and the player with the greater hand wins. If both the players have the same handtype then the player with the Highest rank cards wins. If none of the conditions are satisfied  then it is a draw.

All the above mentioned scenarios  have been covered in the unit test cases.
